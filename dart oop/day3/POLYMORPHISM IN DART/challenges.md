# challenge 1

Scenario: You are developing a multiplayer online battle game for "GameMaster". The game features different types of characters, such as "Warrior", "Mage", and "Archer". Each character has their own unique ability that can be activated during battles. As part of the game development, you need to implement polymorphism using method overriding in Dart to handle the character abilities. 
 
Example of character abilities: 
- Warrior: "Berserk Mode" - Increases attack power and defense temporarily. 
- Mage: "Fireball" - Casts a powerful fireball that damages multiple enemies. 
- Archer: "Precision Shot" - Takes careful aim to deliver a highly accurate and powerful shot. 
 
Question:  provide an example of how you would apply polymorphism by method overriding in Dart to handle the character abilities in the "GameMaster" game.

Hint: we have class Character (parent or super class) and subclassess Warrior,Mage,Archer and method called useAbility
